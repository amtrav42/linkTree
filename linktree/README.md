  Amelia's linktree Challenge

Included in this file is the start of creating a linktree with multiple link types. Please contact me if there are any problems getting this project running.

Please clone this repo

and run:

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

Or 

    ```shell
    npm start
    ```
should work as well

The site will now be running at `http://localhost:8000`!
